ROS2 Workspace
##############

.. attention:: The following workspace structure is recommended in general, but is mandatory for shared devices (i.e. every device that is not your own computer, like Raspberry Pis or lab computers) to avoid confusion.

We use :file:`ros2` as depicted in :numref:`ros2-dev-workspace-structure` as development workspace and :file:`ros2_underlay` shown in :numref:`ros2-underlay-workspace-structure` for larger manually compiled non-development packages that take a lot of time to compile/recompile.

Having them in a separate workspace reduces compilation time for the development workspace.
Typical packages for :file:`ros2_underlay` are :code:`plot_juggler`, :code:`px4_msgs`, :code:`apriltag_ros` and everything that is not going to be modified regularily.
