Contributing to Documentation

Forking the Repository
**********************
Go to this documentation's `GitHub repository <https://github.com/HippoCampusRobotics/docs>`_ and fork it (see `GitHub's documentation <https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo>`_ for details on forking if you do not know how to fork a repository).

Then clone your fork with ``git clone`` so you can work with the repository locally.

Make your Changes
*****************

Modify or complement the existing .rst-files to your liking.

Help with the most common ReStructuredText/Sphinx directives can be found `here <https://documentation-style-guide-sphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html>`_. For a more extensive documentation of the capabilities of Sphinx visit the official `website <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/contents.html>`_.

Build the Docs locally
**********************

Since Sphinx follws the `WYSIWYM paradigm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM>`_, it is a good idea to build the ``html`` output, to check if your changes work out as expected.

Probably easiest way to do so is to setup a virtual environment for python by executing the following commmand inside your cloned fork of the documentation repository:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment with

.. code-block:: bash

   source venv/bin/activate


and install the Sphinx dependencies by executing

.. code-block:: bash

   pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Now you can build the documentation by running

.. code-block:: bash

   make html

.. note:: Always make sure to have the virtual environment activated when executing the ``make html`` command.

View the HTML output
********************

You can view the HTML output by opening :file:`_build/html/index.html` with a webbrowser.

Autogenerate Documentation
**************************

.. attention:: Autodoc is disabled for now. Either implement a docker workflow to build the docs where all runtime dependencies of the documented source code are met or just don't use autodoc. We stick with the latter one for now.

To generate API documentation for Python packages add the them as submodule under the :file:`src` directory.

.. code-block:: console

   $ PKG_NAME="insert-your-package-name-here" && \
   git submodule add https://github.com/HippoCampusRobotics/$PKG_NAME.git src/$PKG_NAME

Add the package name to the :code:`packages` list in :file:`conf.py`.

Then add the package in :file:`src.rst`. If you get errors/warning telling you that something related to your newly added package could not be imported, make sure you add all external modules imported in your package/modules to the :code:`autodoc_mock_imports` list in :file:`conf.py`.
